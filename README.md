This repository contains Matlab R2020a code to load the data used in the manuscript entitled __"Quantitative Evaluation of Predictability of Linear Reduced-order Model based on Particle-image-velocimetry Data of Flow Field around Airfoil"__ published in [Experiments in Fluids, Vol. 62, 112, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-021-03205-8)  and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12239).  
Although the reduced order model code is not included, the same data are available by nunning the program. 
To run the program, download and extract the database and execute `P01_loadmat_makeimage`.  

## Database description
---
- Small Low Turbulence Wind Tunnel in Institute of Fluid Science
- Separated flow of 10 m/s freestream around 100 mm NACA0015
- Time-resolved PIV of 5000 Hz pair images with Photoron SA-X2 and Photonics Industries, DM30-527
- Measured on December 5th 2018 by Koki Nankai and Atsushi Komuro
- PIV is processed by Dantec Dynamic Studio
- The time step of velocity data is \Delta f c/u_{\infty} = 0.02 

See the corresponding paper for more details.

## Directory
---
- src: directory in which the source code is stored  
- work: directory in which the calculation results are stored (created automatically by running the program)  
  - 18deg: directory for the case for 18 deg of angle of attack
    - PIV_flowfield: directory for the PIV data  
      - u: directory for images of u-velocity are stored
      - v: directory for images of v-velocity are stored
